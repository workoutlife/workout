If your pre-workout is beyond this date yes it has expired. Best recommendation is to keep in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight. There are times when you should never use a past date supplement - such as if you are faced with moldy pre workout. So i have a couple pre workout products that are going to expire in about 2 weeks and i know i will not be able to finish them all before they expire so i was wondering if i should just throw them out or if. Most ingredients will work best within date but some people will opt to use the supplement anyway.</p>
