<p>Hello GLL long time guest first time posting here. The cremaster is like the Goldilocks of the scrotum. So a couple of weeks ago I was fooling around and realised that I can move my balls voluntarily. The cremaster muscle is a muscular sac that envelops the testicle and supports it just like a hammock. At the threat of danger or exposure to extreme cold the cremaster draws the testicle.</p>
