<p>Pin On Weight Gainer Before And After When should I take mass gainer before or after a workout. If you wish to gain weight the mass gainer can be taken within 15 to 20 mins post workout. If you want to have more stamina and energy at the time of workout then you need to take your mass gainer supplement before a workout. It provides enough nutrients to your muscle to enhance your gym performance. You can have the mass gainer supplement at least 30 minutes before a workout. It depends on what your ultimate goal is.</p>
